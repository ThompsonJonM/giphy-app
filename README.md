CHANGELOG

READ FROM BOTTOM TO TOP

20170609 - 1533

APP.JS: Added stop/go function for images. Now the gifs load in a still state and do not animate until clicked. This was a bit of a slog.

20170609 - 1259

INDEX.HTML: Added reset button.

APP.JS: Added reset function.

20170609 - 1250

APP.JS: Got the code to work! Fixed elements within the API which allowed the code to call more than one object when the function executes thanks to a for-loop within the function. Prior to this, I did not realize that the data from the API was organized in an array and, due to this, needed to be ported with "[]".

INDEX.HTML: Adjusted the names of some HTML elements. Briefly tried using separate divs for both the rating and gif image but abandoned it when it didn't look great to me.

20170609 - 1148

INDEX.HTML: Added bootstrap and all the trimmings.

APP.JS: Began working on code framework. It does not currently work which is frustrating.

20170609 - 0848

INDEX.HTML: Created.

APP.JS: Created.

RESET.CSS: Created and forgotten.

STYLESHEET.CSS: Created.
